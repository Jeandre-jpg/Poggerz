## About The Project

### Project Description

An Android closed-group Chat Application about all things about the band, Gorrilaz. This app uses Kotlin and Google Firebase. The app focuses on the British Band, Gorillaz. The band was created by Damon Albarn from the Britpop band Blur and Jamie Hewlett. Their style is reminiscent of 80's dance music with strong influences from hip-hop, dub, electro, and pop (Gorillaz 1998). 

The theme of my chat focuses on the fictional animated band: Gorillaz who consists of four animated members: 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs.  Their fictional universe is presented in music videos, interviews and short cartoons. I wanted to create an app that centred around fans of the band and a place to discuss, lore, characters, phases and their music style.

## Development Process

### Implementation

## Peer Reviews

### Peer 1:

* Very unique concept for the app, unlike others i have seen before.
* The concept is very much a unique one to itself. I like the creativity behind it.
* The aesthetic is well achieved throughout the app with all the imagery being unique to The Gorillaz. The colours are also nice, although the hot pink against the dark blue can be a bit harsh on the eyes, maybe saturating the pink a little bit could help with that?
* The authentication views are great, they serve their purpose and are super easy to access.
* The portfolio view is very well done, the layout is very nice and intuitive to use, and the accessibility of it through the navigation drawer makes it very easy to access.
* From what was shown, the conversation view seemed to have a very busy background with the camouflage imagery, maybe a more plain colour or less busy background would make the viewer less distracted when chatting on that page. 
* The navigation drawer makes everything easy to come by, very well done.
* If I were to see this app on the play store I would think that it was like a fan-based app for people who like the gorillaz, which is totally fine but I'm not a die hard fan of the band so I wouldn't download it for myself. Although for my friends that are big fans of the band, I would definitely recommend this app to them.
* Like I mentioned preciously, I think the hot pink on the dark background is a bit harsh on the eyes, so possibly saturating the pink colour would help that a bit. And the camoflage imagery in the background of the chat app is a bit distracting so maybe a more plain or less distracting background would be better!


### Peer 2:

* Super intrigued by the popping colour scheme and the loading animation, with the whole characters and crazy font, really cool JeandrÃ©.
* Very creative, I have never seen anything like it before. The concept is fun, I can imagine it being specificallt for the band only in a sense, like a customized personalized app just for the Gorillaz.
* Eye catching, and visually pleasing, I would maybe just dim the colour down a bit as they might disract a bit, but it also fits the theme. Maybe just darken them?
* Intuitive as after the loading animation the login screen pops up, maybe make the Login and Register headings more clear with different colour backgrounds maybe?
* The menu icon is maybe a bit small, but either than that navigating through the app and profile page is optimal.
* There a 2 chat menu items, just make sure of that, as it can be a bit confusing.
* The navigstion made sense. Not very confusing at all. Well done Jeandre!
* Purely for the reason of choosing my own character in the whole concept and theme sounds and looks exciting.
* Just some minor colour changes and tweaks like the double menu icon, and use colour to shoecase important text switching to register.

### Peer 3:

* Very cool, makes you say "wow" when you first see it!
* Super duper creative and unique, never seen anything like this
* Could be a little bit overwhelming on the guys in some places with too many bright colours, but it is really fun.
* Validation all works and looks nice, the text edit boxes could be a little bit difficult to see.
* Not sure if everything works yet, probably a work in progress but the layout is setup and looks good, got everything you need
* Conversations and chats are also a work in progress, but setup for functionality so all good.
* Very easy to navigation with the burger menu allowing you to see every page clearly.
* I'm on the fence because I'm not particularly interested in the Gorillaz but I do think the app is very fun and lively.
* Maybe edit some pages where the colours are a bit overwhelming and make the text edit boxes on the authentication pages easier to see.
* Awesome Jeandre, this is a really unique app and its really cool that you didn't just go with a generic application look but rather decided to give it a whole theme.
